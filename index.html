        <h1>Logitech G633 vs G933</h1>
      </div>

      <p><b>tldr; G933 is very bad.</b></p>

      <p>I bought the wired <a href="http://www.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/product/logitech-logitech-g633-gaming-headset-with-microphone-black-981-000586/10390348.aspx">Logitech G633 ($199)</a> and 
      wireless <a href="http://www.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/product/logitech-logitech-g933-wireless-gaming-headset-black-981-000585/10390347.aspx?path=472bd98d0255a9be944ed678d895c3aden02">Logitech G933 ($249)</a> headsets,
      with the intent to try both and shamelessly return one of them.</p>

      <p>The results surprised me; the wireless G933 had a steady static sound in the background, which got <b>very</b> audible as the volume increased, but which was still very obvious even at normal listening levels.</p>

      <p>I can't easily caputre the difference in how they produce sound, but I can easily capture how *awful* the microphone is on the more expensive wireless G933.</p>

      <p>
      <b>If you can't hear a difference, turn up your volume. The G933 is extremely noisy.</b>
      </p>

      <p>Both recordings were made on a 2015 Macbook Pro, seconds apart, using the same hardware and software. The same noise persists on my Windows 10 desktop.</p>
