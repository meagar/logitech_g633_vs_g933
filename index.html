      <p><b>tldr; G933 is very bad.</b></p>

      <p>I bought the wired [Logitech G633 ($199)][1] and wireless [Logitech G933 ($249)][2] headsets, with the intent to try both and shameless return one of them.</p>

      <p>The results surprised me; the wireless G933 had a steady static sound in the background, which got <b>very</b> audible as the volume increased, but which was still very obvious even at normal listening levels.</p>

      <p>I can't easily caputre the difference in how they produce sound, but I can easily capture how *awful* the microphone is on the more expensive wireless G933.</p>
